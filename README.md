- This tutorial is much like the one for Django

##### Sunday, October 25, 2020
- I played with the Jinja2 templating subsystem quite a bit, putting links on the home page.
    - I downloaded the latest Bootstrap, for future-use
- One big difference I notice between Flask and Django is that Django supports DateTime objects in the template
- I am not wild about the naming conventions used in this tutorial--I much prefer Miguel's, which are very similar to those used in Django.
- I finished the main part of the tutorial, and will finish the extra parts for future development (this is something that wasn't in the Django tutorial).
